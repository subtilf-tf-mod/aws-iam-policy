# Terraform module of  AWS - IAM Policy - Just for learn purpose!!! 

ll terraform modules from my repositories is only for learn purpose, so it can be broken, incomplete or not working well!

So if you use that code be careful and you will be at your own!!! Good lucky!!!

# What is an IAM Policy?
AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) is a web service that helps you securely control access to AWS resources. You use IAM to control who is authenticated (signed in) and authorized (has permissions) to use resources.

When you first create an AWS account, you begin with a single sign-in identity that has complete access to all AWS services and resources in the account. This identity is called the AWS account root user and is accessed by signing in with the email address and password that you used to create the account. We strongly recommend that you do not use the root user for your everyday tasks, even the administrative ones. Instead, adhere to the best practice of using the root user only to create your first IAM user. Then securely lock away the root user credentials and use them to perform only a few account and service management tasks.

# Motivation
I wrote a lot of codes using terraform modules and for each individual project I had to replicated the modules.

Therefore as terraform accept to work with remote repositories I decided to use github as my source of terraform modules.

# About the project
This project just store the common git files (license and readme.md) and terraform files (main, var and output).
